  "description": "Our first night in London could not have been nicer! Fiona greeted us as family. My Pims Cup was made to perfection garnished with a perfectly sliced cucumber. We had lamb and a Chicken Kiev as entries. Her soup was vegetable using chicken stock and a highlight of the meal. Book reservations early since she sold out well before we arrived.",
