  "description": "I had one day in London and I decided to spend the only meal I had time to eat here. After a long day of pounding pavement, the last thing I wanted to do on a Friday night was to fight for a table at a loud pub. Ffiona's was a delightful gem in the middle of a bustling city. Ffiona actually greeted us when we walked through the door. The ambiance was beautiful with candlelight, chalkboard menus and sheet music wallpaper. I had the fish and chips, my first London meal. And, my mom had the peppercorn steak. We shared sides of spicy butternut squash and steamed greens. Everything was fulfilling and delicious. My favorite food parts of this place were the mushy peas and the greens. What comfort food! \n\nAlthough the food was fantastic, my overall favorite part of this trip was Ffiona. She sat with patrons as they ate as if she'd know them for years when in fact they only stopped in moments before. Some she actually has known for years. You couldn't tell the difference. For all I knew, I was at Ffiona's house as her friend. Her food was delicious, her personality was more than satisfying. I will return to Ffiona's again and again.",
