  "description": "Went to the Pink Onion around 9:45pm on a Thursday night based on the recommendation of a friend who lives in the neighborhood. We felt a bit self conscious as it seemed to be near closing time. It did not matter! We were greeted warmly and not rushed in any way. The intimate, casual atmosphere was very comfortable. And the food was really delicious. Devoured the homemade bread (think it's the same dough as the pizza). Loved the flavors of the meatballs. Incredible. Also really enjoyed the pasta with pesto. As we sipped our second beers, we chatted with the guys who created the place. It's really a wonderful place with great food.",
