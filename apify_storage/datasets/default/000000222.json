  "description": "The food here is great! I discovered Pink Onion through a Yelp Elite event and finally made it back here. We got the burrata salad (no meat), the usfincione (sp?) pizza, a cannoli, some rose and port wines. Overall the food was DELICIOUS! They did not disappoint! \n\nThe fresh warm bread, burrata salad, and the pizza are delicious. I HIGHLY recommend the usfincione pizza. It's unlike anything you can get anywhere else. Admittedly, the description makes you question it... I mean pine nuts and currants on pizza??? But trust me! AMAZING! The cannoli was one of the better ones I've had in SF, but as a born and raised Bostonian who is used to freshly filled cannolis that have that nice crunch to it with the fresh ricotta filling, I was a little disappointed that these cannolis were just a tad soft and a little too sweet for my taste. But let's be real, the amazingness of the rest of the food way overshadowed any slight flaws my overly picky self could care about with the cannolis. \n\nAlso, their rose and port were ON POINT. So good! \n\nI've already been recommending this to everyone I know who likes good pizza (which let's be real -- is everyone). Not to mention, it's a great place where a vegetarian like me can go and enjoy food alongside my carnivorous friends and everyone comes out happy. So if you've made it this far in the review, and are still trying to decide if you should check them out - it's a no brainer. Go!",
