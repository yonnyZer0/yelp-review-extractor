  "description": "I'm sad I haven't written this review yet. We went to Ffiona's about 7 months ago on the the last leg of our trip to London and Paris. We had the most delightful meal at Ffiona's on one of our first nights back from Paris to Kensington. The chicken Kiev was off the charts amazing. The service was as great as the meal. We had our 3 year old daughter with us, who is (apologies for gloating) an excellent traveler and amateur restauranteur , and the staff could not have been anymore accommodating to her dairy/soy allergies as well as just being very nice by talking to the kiddo and kept her entertained. We had such a pleasant experience that we made reservations for brunch on our last morning in London, but when we got there, there was some sort of problem with the gas lines for the kitchen. Fiona came right out, remembered us right away (we were only there the night before or so) and was sincerely apologetic. Not only was she so apologetic, but she sent us to another restaurant nearby that had an excellent breakfast (Fiona said it was where she gets breakfast when she's not working, which is apparently never). I need to head back to London soon, because if the brunch is half as good as the chicken Kiev, I'd consider moving out of New York!!!",
