  "description": "Maybe my favorite pizza in SF. So, so good.\n\nThe crust is perfection. Just the right balance of doughy and crispy, and always flavorful.\n\nThere's something for everyone on the menu (except people who don't like pizza, obviously).\n\nAnd totally unpretentious, with a bar vibe. Probably not the spot for a fancy occasion.\n\nNot much else to say, except go and try it. Don't let the unassuming location -- it's squeezed in a strip mall between Best Bay and the other big box retailers in the \"under the freeway\" part of SoMA -- deter you.",
