  "description": "What a marvelous place.  The food is excellent and Ffiona is such a gregarious and creative cook.  This is simply one of my favorites in London.  Fish and chips was delightful and the lamb superb.  Great list of sides and a varied menu featuring fresh ingredients in season.\nThis is a good place for family, friends, or couples.  It is on the smallish side so I recommend that you call ahead for a reservation or drop Fiona an email.\nThe location is Kensington with a simple storefront.  It was not too far from public transportation.\nLoved talking to Fiona and her staff.  This is a gem and worth the trip to dine there.",
