  "description": "This place was decent, but not 4.5 stars in my book. More like 3.5\n\nPizza is a bit greasy with a floppy crust on the cheese end of the pie. The crust is good. Ingredients are good quality.\n\nI ordered the pink onion - great set of ingredients, but boy was it spicy! I think the spice is part of the sauce itself. I'm Indian and even this pie was too spicy for my taste. So spicy I couldn't even finish it. On the plus side I inadvertently side portion controlled.\n\nIf the pie was less spicy I'd give it a 4 stars for delivery pizza",
