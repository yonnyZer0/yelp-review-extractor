  "description": "Excellent food.  I had the lamb and it was cooked perfectly with an excellent mint sauce.  The others at my table had the chicken kiev and it was amazing.  Get the blueberry cobbler for dessert.  Excellent and very personal service. I will definitely come back here when in Kensington.",
