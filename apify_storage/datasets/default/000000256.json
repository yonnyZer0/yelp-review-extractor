  "description": "Pink Onion is a great, low-key pizza place; they are self-described as \"Pizza without the stupid bullshit\". They have a bunch of non-basic pizzas, as well as authentic Sicilian style pizzas (allegedly, I'm Asian so no clue). I really like this place and would definitely come out of my way to eat here.\n\nThe Pink Onion is a pretty intimate place, there might be a wait because it fills up pretty fast. Service is nice, but can be overwhelmed sometimes.\n\nI ordered in descending preference:\nTyson's punch out (my ultra favorite)\nBurrata +stuff - super creamy\nMargherita - was weird because didn't have think crust, but I liked it anyways\nSchiacciatta (Sicilian) - lots of mild cheese, looks like a calzone from far away. This is last, but it was still good, just very different from any pizza I've ever had.",
