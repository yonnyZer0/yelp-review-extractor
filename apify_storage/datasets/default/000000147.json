  "description": "Ahhhhh I'm IN LOVE. I just moved here and was looking for pizza delivery and Pink Onion had great reviews. Their menu is amazing - I want to try everything! I got the Pink Alarm Fire pizza and a green salad. A small pizza fed me for 3 meals and was honestly the best pizza I've had in such a long time. They also gave me bread because I ordered a salad and no, I did not need bread with my pizza, but of course I had to try it and it was amazing. Delivery was also super fast. Yes, it was a bit pricey, but for spectacular pizza it is worth it. I can't wait to visit this place in person and hopefully try everything on the menu :)",
