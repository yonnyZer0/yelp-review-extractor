  "description": "Absolute gem! We were so happy when we called (last minute) for a reservation and got in. Down home cooking at a friendly budget and that takes your breath away! Ffiona was absolutely wonderful to us and we're a mixed couple of girls so I'm not sure about the complaints on discrimination. Word to the wise: listen to what is being offered, she means what she's saying if something is good or recommended. And, we're the travelers in her house so take it easy, enjoy some wine and order some delicious food, everything else will fall into place. We had so much fun we made a new friend for life. I'm so thrilled we decided to come in despite the few scary reviews. \n\nWe ordered: half bottle of white wine, fizzy water, scallops for appetizer, chicken Kiev, an assortment of sides, the special seafood stew, and last but not least, sticky toffee pudding. Everything is a must order.",
