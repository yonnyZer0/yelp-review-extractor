  "description": "We really liked this place a lot, Fiona was very personable as was her server. We were walk ins with not having \"booked\" a table yet she accommodated our party of 3. She made a tequila cocktail she called \"summer in a glass\" which was very refreshing. We had steak, spiraled sweet potato pasta, chicken Kiev which was a big hit. A yummy green salad shared with fresh parmesan dressing!",
