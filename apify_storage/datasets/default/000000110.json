  "description": "Really wonderful little spot! Came here for their special schiacciata - it did not disappoint!!! Our server was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was casual. Thoroughly enjoyed our wine with the meal and the experience as a whole! Our friends had the pizza and said it was simple but well done.\n\nWould definitely recommend!",
