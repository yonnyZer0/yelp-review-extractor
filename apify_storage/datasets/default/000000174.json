  "description": "What a gem! Our daughter found Ffiona's on yelp as we were wrapping up a full day of sightseeing. Much to our surprise we were able to get a table for 4. So happy they could fit us in at the last minute. It's not a big place so call ahead for reservations. We were fortunate and, after eating there, would have missed out on something really special. The food was phenomenal, service great and the atmosphere buzzing. One of our best nights in London.",
