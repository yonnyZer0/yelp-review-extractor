  "description": "This is a neighborhood gem. The proprietors are friendly and attentive and the food is special. My husband and I ordered salads, which were very fresh. We then split the \"ice tank\" pizza, which had a thin, tasty crust and innovative, yummy toppings. Definitely recommended for an easy, simple, delicious dinner.",
