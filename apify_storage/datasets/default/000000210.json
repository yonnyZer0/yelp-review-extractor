  "description": "Incredible!  Everything about it.  Perfect, small, cozy and friendly atmosphere. Very welcoming proprietor (Ffiona, herself) and wonderfully pleasant staff.  Food is superb. Had pork chops with amazing wine reduction; chicken Kiev - outstanding and the sticky pudding, not to be missed.  This is a quaint and beautiful spot not to be missed when in London.",
