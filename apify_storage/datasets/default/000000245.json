  "description": "Fun surprise in my 'hood. Really tasty, well made pizzas. The salad I took home was a bit disappointing but I tend to like a lot of stuff on my salad and compared to the pizza it was just meh. They have a decent beer and wine selection and it was fun to sit and have a glass while waiting for my pie. I hope these guys make it and find their groove. Lots of potential and we need to give Little Star some competition!",
