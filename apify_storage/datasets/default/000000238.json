  "description": "So I've never left a review for any restaurant before but I had to for pink onion, Basically everything I tried was delicious and the staff was soo nice to me. I had the pink alarm fire pizza, it's not that spicy for me but it's absolutely delicious, the bread is unreal and the pistachio pesto may be the best pasta I have tried!! Thanks pink onion for taking care of me and giving me an awesome new pizza spot in SF!!",
