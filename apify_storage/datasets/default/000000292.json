  "description": "Finally an Italian joint in SFO that is owned and operated by a Sicilian . The red sauce is the best west or east of Italy . Knocks Little Italy in New York City on its ass . North Beach , Prince Street in Boston the same . If you want authentic Sicilian in SFO this is the place . The meatballs are the best on the planet . Frank Lococo will knock your socks off !",
