  "description": "Splitting this review into two sections, service and food. \n\nService: 2 Stars. Made reservations. They sat us outside in the cold because there was no room inside (its small). Ordered 2 apps and a main to share. Took over an hour to get our main course. Maybe they were short on staff. Though they were friendly they seemed to be scrambling and service wasn't great.\n\nFood: 3 Stars. The apps were so-so (grilled Romain/garlic salad, and burrata app. Lacked a bit of flavor. Extra Parmesan cheese helped a little. Main course was spaghetti and meatballs. Sauce was great, meatballs were pretty good. Pasta was cooked well. \n\nAll in all I expected more with all 5 star reviews. Probably wouldn't go back at this point.",
