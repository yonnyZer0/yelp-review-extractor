  "description": "I was a bit disappointed with the dishes. We ordered:\n\nMeatballs appetizer- bland, needed salt. The consistency was cooked just right but something was lacking.\n\nTruffle bruschetta- bland, also needed salt. I really wanted to like it because of the truffle but lacked seasoning. \n\nU'sfincione- my favorite dish of the dinner. It's their one of their two Sicilian pizzas. It was savory, soft, and not dry. I loved that it had  pine nuts and caramelized onions providing the sweetness and crunch to the dish.",
