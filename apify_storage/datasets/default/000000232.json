  "description": "In a city (and neighborhood) getting pretty crowded with pizza places Pink Onion is a worthy new addition! \n\nIt brings unique value in the form of Sicilian style pizza crusts - which is served two ways: either permitted fully to rise into focaccia like texture (the u'sficcioni) or sliced in half and served almost like pita and sandwiched around ricotta and pepper (the schiacciata). Both are delicioso! \n\nBeyond these specialty pizzas the \"regular\" Italian style pizza menu has a wide range of tasty toppings and well prepared thin crust. I've enjoyed the Guido prosciutto and arugula pizza with several different audiences. \n\nDrink menu is wine and beer only, but thoughtfully considered and reasonably priced, high end, on-tap selection in both categories. The staff has been awesome about letting us sample wines before committing to the full liter or half liter portions. Always delighted to see Ballast grapefruit sculpin on a menu!\n\nAmbiance is intimate and fun (but note: not very quiet) - about four seated tables and six seats at the bar only, reservations definitely recommended, especially on a Friday, where I've noticed it's frequently standing room only.",
