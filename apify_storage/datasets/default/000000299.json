  "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE. The first time I tried pink onion, we ordered takeout through Postmates, and our delivery guy was late in showing up. Though that was a mistake that was totally on him, and not the restaurants fault, they made us a new hot pizza, and upgraded the size to boot! Customer service in every experience has been above and beyond and the food is always the best quality. Highly recommend their Giovanni and U'sfincione pizzas, and their fresh pasta offerings as well. We love that pistachio pesto! AND the bruschettas, especially their seasonal offerings are just, yum!  No complaints, this is just good solid eats from awesome people!",
