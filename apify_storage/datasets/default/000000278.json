  "description": "Came in on a Wednesday night about 45 minutes before they close. Frank and Greg were both awesome hosts and unbelievable cooks. We had the meatballs and the Guido pizza. Both were unbelievable. We can't explain how great this experience was. These guys really care about the food and experience. Great authentic Sicilian food in San Francisco!!!",
