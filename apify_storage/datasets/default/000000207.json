  "description": "Everything was delicious. The Parmesan salad was lovely. The lamb was exquisite. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing. Ffiona was warm and friendly, and very accommodating to our gluten-free companion. We had the duck pate for starter and she brought out some gluten free toast for him, with extra pate! Wonderful evening and would come back if we are in town!",
