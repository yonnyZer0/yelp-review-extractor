  "description": "Bravo. Family run, warm spirited local Italian with great pizza and pasta, and a friendly neighborhood vibe. We stumbled in to order to go food after eating at Rintaro next door (also awesome) and were treated to free bread and olive oil, free wine, free water and cheer while we waited for our pizzas. This is how it's supposed to be done.",
