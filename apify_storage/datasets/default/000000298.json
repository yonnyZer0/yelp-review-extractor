  "description": "We went on a late Wednesday night after 10 p.m. just as the staff was cleaning up and getting ready to close. I asked if they are still serving food; Frank (one of the owners) came out to welcomed us, and even gave us free very good Vermouth to start! It was kind of nice to be the only customers because we got the rock star treatment! Suffice to say, the service was excellent and attentive. Never did we feel rushed or the need to hurry up and leave. We ordered two pasta dishes (Black Summer Truffle Pasta and Pappardelle Bolognese) and a small Calabrese pizza. Although Frank apologized for our food being prepared at the end of the night, we thought everything tasted as they should, full of flavor and great texture. In fact, the food tasted very fresh and in my opinion better than other similar establishments we've sampled. If you are in the neighborhood, definitely give Pink Onion a go. Maybe get there as they are closing and receive similar rock star treatment!",
