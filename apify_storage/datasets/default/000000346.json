  "description": "I never like to write Yelp reviews, but damn, I'll write it for the Pink Onion.\n\nBesides the funky atmosphere and amazing artwork (which turns out was done by some famous local artists), I was in love with the beer selection! Loved that they partnered with Standard Deviant down the street for some great craft beers.\n\nTheir pistachio pesto was unreal and I kinda forgot to share some with my girlfriend, but the pizza more than made up for me stuffing my face. 100% would come back and recommend. Will be coming back again soon and bringing friends.",
