  "description": "I absolutely love Pink Onion! Great wine options, affordable price point, and delicious options for both pasta and pizza. The portion sizes are quite large where a large pizza and pasta would probably be enough to feed most groups of 3 /4 (that's coming from someone with a big appetite). They are generous with their wine pours where you can get a carafe from any of their wines on tap.\n\nThe atmosphere is cute, though it can get a little loud at times due to the size.  Overall, I definitely recommend giving Pink Onion a try if you like tasty Italian food for a great price.",
