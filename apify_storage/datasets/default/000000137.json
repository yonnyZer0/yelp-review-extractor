  "description": "After reading all of the great reviews on Yelp we decided that this would be our first meal in London. Naively we headed to Ffiona's on a Saturday night without a reservation and a group on 7!\n\nThe placed was packed when we arrived at 7:30.  After walking 1.75 miles to get there I was suddenly filled with fear upon arrival that the rest of my party would be upset, to put it lightly, if we couldn't get in. We patiently waited 10 minutes at the door and then were asked if we had a reservation. No I respond with trepidation, um Ffiona says, I'm not sure we can get you in. A few minutes later a large group gets up and miraculously we are seated!\n\nIf you want to dine here, be smarter than me and make a reservation.\n\nWe were seated next to a regular who was kind enough to provide us with some recommendations.\n\nWe ordered the beef and liver pie, so tasty.  The top is puff pastry the liver was perfectly cooked. Not grainy.\n\nThe Hake(fish) was the best item on the menu!\n\nThe fish and chips were well executed with a moist interior and a crispy exterior.\n\nThe pork chop was the second best item! It was so moist and well seasoned.\n\nMussels were good, everything was great. \n\nDo yourself a favor and come here.",
