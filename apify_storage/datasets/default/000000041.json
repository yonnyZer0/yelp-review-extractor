  "description": "VIBE: \nSuper comfortable inviting restaurant with delicious homey food.\n\nFOOD:\nGrilled avacado - yummy, the pesto sauce that came with it was really good\n\nFish & chips - fish was super good, crunchy on the out side and the fish was perfectly cooked. However I was not a fan of the thick dense fries.\n\nChocolate cheese cake - not good, it taste grainy with a weird texture. I only ate the ice cream.\n\nToffee cake - good, but really strong toffee flavor. If u don't like toffee or strong flavors in general I would avoid this.",
