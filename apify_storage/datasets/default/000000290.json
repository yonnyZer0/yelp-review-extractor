  "description": "Wow, really superb food and service. It's a newish and small restaurant, but it's packed with amazing Italian fare, pizza, and cool people. \n\nTheir dinner menu is mostly pizza-focused, which is more than ok with me! But we did indulge in some impressive appetizers too, like their special truffle bruschetta. It had fresh ricotta, olive oil, parmesan, and gorgeous shavings of black truffle! With a little sprinkle of salt and cracked black pepper, they were heavenly. Our group ordered the Guido, Giovanni, and The Kanouti pizzas. Upon first taste, we all couldn't shut up about how good the sauce was - it mild yet bright and flavorful. Whoever made that sauce really knows what they're doing, folks. The crust was flawless too. I highly recommend the Guido pizza, which was generously layered with quality prosciutto, arugula, and fresh parm. Everyone loved what they ordered and I considered risking the deep discomfort of my pine nut allergy just to eat that pesto pizza.\n\nAfter, we yucked it up with the mother-daughter duo that own the joint. We shared stories of travel, our passion for food, and I showed them my photos from mushroom foraging over the years. Smarten up and make a reservation on Yelp right now!",
