  "description": "On our short stay in London, we were lucky enough to stumble upon Ffiona's on our first night. We hadn't heard many good things about British fare but this place proved that wrong. It was a very cozy, hospitable atmosphere - although the benches by the window weren't exactly the most comfortable. He had ordered the pork chop which was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and not dry like most pork chops with a side of the best mashed potatoes he claims he has ever had. I had ordered what I thought was the special with hake but received a dish with veggie noodles which was amazing by itself (warm zucchini noodles w/ carrots, multigrains and nuts). I had asked where my hake was and I guess there was a misunderstanding when I had ordered. Fiona had rectified the problem right away - my hake came quickly after. For dessert, we had to try the sticky toffee pudding which was a tad too sweet for us but my teeth were still intact after finishing the whole thing! I was actually not feeling too well from walking around in the cold rain, but the food here LITERALLY WARMED MY SOUL. It was the first time I felt warm ever since arriving. Service was excellent. Times are posted on the door - we were sad we wouldn't be able to make it back for another meal. We will visit this place the next time we are in London for sure!",
