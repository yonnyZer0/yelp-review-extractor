  "description": "When I book a table for two and walk into a restaurant with empty tables, I don't expect to be mandated to sit at the bar.\n\nThe greeter was really rude and wouldn't let me sit at my booked table.\n\nThe ruder he got, the more I dug my heels in and insisted on the table. I got the table and they're getting this terrible review.\n\nToo many great restaurants in this city for me to waste my time in that gin joint.\n\nAnd that greeter either needs to be retrained in restaurant etiquette, or needs to be fired. I know what I'd do.",
