  "description": "Yum! Such a great spot. It happen to be a beautiful warm night in the city and we thought we'd treat ourselves to some pizza in an outdoor setting. The place is pretty small (maybe 25 ppl max?) so when we arrived the outdoor tables (two of them) were taken. No big deal we sat ourselves at the bar and it was great. We talked to the owner who was super cool and friendly. Menus: there was a lot of them. One for wines, one for beers, one for regular menu, one for specials. Good selection of beers on tap, and also wine on tap too. There was also a tv at the bar if you are a solo diner and wanted to sit at the bar and watch some tv, grub on some pizza. \n\nWe got the tyson's punch which is sausage, mushroom, ricotta on delicious light pizza dough. I'm not a big fan of crust but this was so good I even gobbled up the crust. The large size was big enough for 2 of us and we took a few slices home. I'd definitely want to come back with a larger group and order a few things to share. Overall awesome experience. Friendly and delicious is all a neighborhood could ask for.  (Also, parking isn't that awful around here.)",
