  "description": "We stopped in on a Friday afternoon for lunch. The location is small, probably can seat 20 people at once which is good so that the owner, Ffiona can interact with you. We had fish and chips and the soup and calamari. The fish was a thick piece fried to perfection with chips that were crispy. The soup was broccoli and it was excellent. The calamari was all rings and came with a nice aioli. Ffiona was pleasant to talk with and when she found out we were from San Francisco she talked alot of her travels to our great city.",
