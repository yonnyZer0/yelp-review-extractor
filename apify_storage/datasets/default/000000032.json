  "description": "Great alternative to your regular pizza chain.. different flavors and great combinations. First time trying this establishment nice music and not too loud to have pizza and drinks with friends.  Not your typical pizza parlor. No Vedia games and loud tv sport games just small mom and pops place for great pizza.",
