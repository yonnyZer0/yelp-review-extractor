  "description": "The best meal we had while in London!! What a pleasant surprise to find this little gem.  When we walked in Fiona herself seated us. She knew almost everyone that walked in the door by name.....if the locals are regulars you know you picked the right restaurant!!\n\nThe restaurant has a very warm feel to it. Not only the decor but the staff as well. Our server was so helpful and nice. We never felt rushed. When I had a question about the wines, she brought me tastes of each! \n\nI had the most delicious scallops and the best sticky toffee pudding ever! I cannot day enough wonderful things about Ffiona's. Just do yourself a favor and go so you can experience it yourself!",
