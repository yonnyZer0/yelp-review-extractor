  "description": "You must get a reservation for brunch. This place is packed! And good reason as the food is awesome! Great breakfast selections that have a mix of classics with Ffiona's originals. I loved my Queen's scramble since it had a great flavor profile. Savory, spicy and tangy! And the haloumi cheese was awesome too. Lots of great things happening here. Really cute place as well with friendly staff.",
