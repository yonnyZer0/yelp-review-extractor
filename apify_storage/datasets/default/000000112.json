  "description": "Really delicious pizza, pasta and salads. We ordered the mushroom pizza, bolgonese pasta, caprese salad, and pink onion salad. Everything tasted great and best of all, the portions were actually sizable. The pizza was definitely a highlight, lots of mushroom flavor and crunchy thin crust. \n\nService was also way above expectations. Definitely check this spot out if you're in the area.",
