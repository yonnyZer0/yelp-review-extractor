  "description": "We went with our two teens and though the last table in the house didn't feel rushed at all. The food was terrific and the service excellent. Would highly recommend. The entrées were fantastic and plentiful. Leave room for dessert. The toffee pudding and crumble with custard are delicious. Ffiona gave us some great tips on other London spots as well. Lovely evening.",
