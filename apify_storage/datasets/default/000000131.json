  "description": "Delicious food.  Wonderfully personalized services. Charming atmosphere.  I spent a week in the London area and this was probably best restaurant experience I had during my time.\n\nWe came in on a weeknight and were able to be seated immediately.  After a few minutes we were greeted with a sweet lady that sat down beside us and explained the menu and some of her favorite items.  We ended up going with a few cocktails, pate and chicken noodle soup to start, and the lamb roast as our entree.  Everything was delicious.  The soup and pate in particular was extremely flavorful and balanced.  We didn't have time for desert as we were running late but looking around, don't think we would have been disappointed.  \n\nPS: Expect European paced service on the check if you're running on a schedule!",
