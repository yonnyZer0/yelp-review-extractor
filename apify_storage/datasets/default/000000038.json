  "description": "Really great for a casual date spot because of its intimidate, neighborhood-y feel. Both the atmosphere and food deserve 5 stars. \n\nWe ordered the Pink Alarm Pizza and the Pasta with Meatballs and they were both fantastic. It's not common for Italian places to be good at both pizza and pasta, so the consistent quality across the two dishes was a nice surprise. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small and has a pleasant bustling atmosphere from the guests coming to dine-in and the pickup/delivery orders. Don't come here expecting attentive service, but the waiters feel like real people that aren't trying to be nice for the sake of being nice. That's a big positive in my book.\n\nPink Alarm Pizza (+ basil) - This was the bomb dot com. It actually had a nice spicy kick; make sure you've got a decent spice tolerance before ordering. All the toppings tasted high-quality, with a great balance between the flavors. We also liked that they sprinkled a heavy dose of garlic powder into the pizza dough - they didn't hold back with the flavor.\n\nPasta with Meatballs - We originally wanted the Bolognese pasta, but they ran out. This was still really good though, with juicy meatballs and perfectly cooked al-dente pasta. I prefer the pizza over this, but it was great to get a mix of both.",
