  "description": "I came here for dinner with my parents on our last night in London and we were not disappointed. The food was lovely and the service was excellent. I had the vegetarian soup and the fish and chips and they were all delicious. My favorite was the sticky toffee pudding which was the perfect way to end our meal. Can't wait to come back to this place when I'm in London again!",
