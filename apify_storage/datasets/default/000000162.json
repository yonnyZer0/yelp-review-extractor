  "description": "Ffiona's has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in London. The food is truly sensational, incredibly creative and fresh, and the staff, including the brilliant owner, are as nice as they come. It's really like having a gourmet meal in a good friends home. You are made to feel so welcomed and then you are lavished with a wonderful meal. Considering how good the food is, the prices are very reasonable. Favorites include the Sunday roasts, the to-die-for Chicken Kiev, the Steak and Kidney Pie, and any lamb dish the wizard chief decides to make. Desserts that send me to the moon include the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had, and the fresh fruit cobblers with a creamy vanilla custard. Amazing dining. I want to wrap my arms around Ffiona's and take it home with me.",
