  "description": "Pink Onion I love you. I have a crazy dog, and I have sat I your very close quarters 4 person patio dining and made it work twice now. Possibly it's easy because I'm across the block and can just abort if it's busy. But I prefer to believe it's because you're good humans who will accommodate someone who has a non-social pup but would like to be semi-social.\n\nGet the truffle bruschetta if it's in special and you like earthy cheesy goodness. Seriously, I normally don't do gluten, and will do this bready goodness. \n\nThey have great wine on tap, and I've done pizza as well, and what I come back for is the truffle bruschetta!",
