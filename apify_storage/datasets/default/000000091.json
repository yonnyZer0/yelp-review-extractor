  "description": "A gem of a restaurant. Truly what you look for in a small time, big delivery restaurant. Fresh ingredients, lively atmosphere and Ffiona herself waiting tables provide a phenomenal experience that you're not soon to forget. We complimented the chef and Marie came out to thank us humbly and we couldn't find enough words to let her know how much we enjoyed our dinner.",
