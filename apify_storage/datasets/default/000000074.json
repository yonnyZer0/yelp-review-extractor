  "description": "We ate here tonight and as for as tiny as it was it got pretty loud in there. The pizza was amazing! Pricey for the size but it was delicious. It took forever to put our order in though. There was like one guy working the whole front. He seemed frazzled half the time and the other half he seemed more concerned with chit chatting with the people at the bar area. He didn't actually stop long enough to listen to what we were saying. My husband asked for a coke/Pepsi whatever they have, he said they had root beer or some orange drink.. The man was walking away before my husband even was able to answer and when the guy came back he brought back both drinks for my husband and just walked away. Like I said the food was amazing it just sucked that every time we needed something we literally had to wave the guy down, even for our check to leave.",
