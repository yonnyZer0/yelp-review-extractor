  "description": "One of the things I look most forward to about going to London is going to  Ffiona's.\n\nThis place is unlike any other restaurant. It truly is magical.\nFrom the moment you enter you feel like you are walking into a dear friends home. That's how Ffiona makes you feel, that you are a part of her family. She is filled with warmth,  kindness and she gives the best hugs.\n\nNow, the food. THE FOOD! \nFavorites- The chicken Kiev haunts me. It's that good.\nI get the same thing every time I go here, and I'm not tempted to try anything else. The chicken is so tender, filled with yummy goodness as you cut into the middle. It is a must have.\n\nThe sticky toffee pudding with custard is the best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had, and I've had more than my share.\n\nI could go on and on, but I won't bore you. If you want an exceptional dining experience. Go to Ffiona's. It's that simple, just make sure to call and make a reservation!\n\n**We miss you already Ffiona! Till next time. From your friends in L.A :)",
