  "description": "My wife and I have been there a few times since they opened and just love it. The food is amazing. But let me clarify. It's not amazing like French Laundry, where everything is meticulous and intended to evoke something new. It's amazing like, now I understand what it might be like to have an Italian grandmother who cooks my favorite dish. That's not to say it isn't sophisticated. The food is unpretentious and elegant at the same time. I'm a big fan of the meatballs and the pizzas. Everything is excellent. \n\nThe beer list was surprisingly large, with a nice selection from Standard Deviant Brewing (down the street).\n\nBesides the food and beer, the service was excellent. They treated us like family. It's definitely a warm atmosphere and we definitely feel at home. We've been big fans of their \"parent\" restaurant (Lo Coco's in Berkeley) and are happy not to have to cross the Bay Bridge to have their food.\n\nWe can't wait to go again.",
