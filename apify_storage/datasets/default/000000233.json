  "description": "The Pink Onion. What a great experience we all had. We has never been before. 12 people in our party ranging from 2 to 87 yrs old. The staff were so accommodating. And the food... Mama Mia! We had the pesto pistachio pasta and the pappardelle with ragu. These are rare dishes of delight in any class of restaurant. All the appetizers and pizzas were classic and unique. You won't get better quality dishes anywhere for any price.Thanks",
