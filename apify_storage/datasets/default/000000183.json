  "description": "We ordered the Margherita Pizza for pick up and were very satisfied.\n\nThe crust was thin but not in an insubstantial way, and the cheese was rrreally good (kinda salty). The sauce was mild and not sweet like some pizza sauces.\n\nI usually don't pig out on pizza but I had 3 slices and could've eaten more. Super tasty.",
