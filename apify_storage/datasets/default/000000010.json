  "description": "i was a great experience dining here, I came here with my family by chance, but it is really amazing restaurant, I think I'm so lucky to find it. I ordered lamp chop my father had steak and my brother had swordfish , waited a little bit long, but considering all the tables were full, it was understandable. All the dishes we ordered were tasty and unique in its own way. Enjoyed.\nThx",
