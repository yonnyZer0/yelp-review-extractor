  "description": "Stopped by to pick up a pizza the other night.  The restaurant is quite small and cute, and the two girls that were there were incredibly nice and helpful.  It seemed very authentic.  The four stars instead of five is for the pizza.  It was good, and very fresh, but wasn't my favorite compared to some other places.  I think the tomato sauce was a bit sweeter than I like.  It would have probably been better with some spicy toppings to balance it.  As it was it was nice and fresh and seemed like it should be amazing, but was actually a little on the bland side.  My partner in crime, who had eaten there before, agreed that he'd enjoyed his previous pizza there (with spicy toppings) more.  Anyway - it's a personal preference, and I'm sure I'll try them again sometime.  I'd recommend it to others.",
