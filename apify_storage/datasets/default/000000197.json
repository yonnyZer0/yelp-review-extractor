  "description": "This a great little place with friendly service, great atmosphere AND really good unfussy delicious pizza - not really thin crust and not deep dish. Excellent fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce for the margharita. Pink Onion salad was great and came with tasty hot bread - like their pizza crust. We sat at the bar, comfortable, easy. It is small and gets busy,  but no wait for us at 6.30 ish without reservation at the bar.\nIt's right near Rainbow Grocery!",
