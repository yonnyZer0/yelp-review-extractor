  "description": "Everything about this restaurant is fantastic - the atmosphere, food, and service are all you could ask for in a casual, yet up-scale dining experience. The caprese salad was delicious and fresh, definitely recommend as your starter if you're planning to carb load with a pizza or pasta. We also ordered the Tyson Punch Out and Kanoute pizzas - both were absolutely delicious. Not to mention the owner offered us and every table in the restaurant free tiramisu. We'll definitely be coming back!",
