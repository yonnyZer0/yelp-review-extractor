  "description": "Delicious is an understatement, but so is overpriced. \n\nThe place is small, cute, and the employees are funny, conversational, laid-back. The pizza is delicious, and lives up to their claim of pizza without bullshit. But what I really came here for what the pappardelle. I am a pappardelle feen. The idea that chowfun-esque noodles can be mixed with hearty, creamy Italian sauces... it just activates the questions of identity within me, and boy do I love it. Pink Onion delivered on my cravings. \n\nBut what's with the pricing? $22 for the pappardelle?? $20 for the small pizzas. If they knocked a couple dollars off the price, they'd see me regularly. But maybe that's why it's priced this way...",
