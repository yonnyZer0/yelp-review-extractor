  "description": "In my 63 years, this is simply the best dinner I have ever had. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Ffiona greeted us with only what I can describe as welcoming us to her home. Her enthusiasm as she described the evening's offerings was contagious. My son, daughter in law and two grandchildren chose different entrees so to get a good variety. We started with prawns, salad and squid appetizers. Fabulous! Then we chose fish & chips, the lamb, duck and marvelous pork chop. All were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth delicious. Will definitely return for another visit before we leave town. I already miss it!! Seriously, you need to check Ffiona's our. You won't be sorry. It would be wise to call ahead for seating although not required.  Ffiona, Marie and Fatima - we will be back! Thank you for an exceptional evening.",
