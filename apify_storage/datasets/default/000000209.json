  "description": "Had our 12th anniversary dinner here tonight (party of 8) and it was excellent! The food, service and personal attention were wonderful. We had some vegan/vegetarian guests and they were all effortlessly taken care of. Everyone loved their meals. Fiona is lovely! It exceeded expectations, I would highly recommend.",
