  "description": "As I begin this review I'm trying my best to do Ffiona's's the credit it deserves for the dining experience my girlfriend and I just had but I know nothing I can write can even come close. The owner is probably the nicest woman I've ever met. We had the vegetable soup, beat noodles (12/10), chicken and leeks and the fish. Everything was absolutely amazing. So good we are headed for brunch on Saturday or Sunday of this week . This restaurant should have 6 out of 5 stars.\n\nThis was a meal we will never forget",
