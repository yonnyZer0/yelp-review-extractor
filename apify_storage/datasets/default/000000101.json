  "description": "Came with friends for dinner on a Thursday evening. I hear it's usually more crowded, but when we went there were probably only 2 other groups seated. We made a reservation through Yelp just in-case, but seemed like we didn't really need it.\n\nEnvironment: The place is actually pretty small, with maybe 6-7 tables and then a bar area. I can see why you'd need to make a reservation if coming on a Friday or weekend. Although small, the place is pretty clean, and the staff was super nice. They came to our table many times to refill our water, and were always checking up on us :)\n\nFood: We got the Tyson Punch Out Pizza and The Kanoute Pizza, both smalls, for 3 people. Each pizza is cut into 6 slices, and the small pizzas are of pretty generous size. We had 3 slices left over, and we were all pretty stuffed afterwards. The Tyson Punch Out Pizza was by far my favorite of the two. The combination of the savory sausages and the creamy and fluffy ricotta was amazing, and the pizza crust was crisp, but still fluffy. The Kanoute was alright. Although they say there's pesto and pistachio and all the other fancy ingredients, I honestly didn't taste much of it. It's a good vegetarian option, but definitely paled in comparison to the Tyson Punch Out. The wait to get our pizzas was a tad long, but they gave us free bread+olive oil as appetizers to hold us down, and it also just goes to show that the pizzas are made fresh!\n\nI would recommend checking this place out!",
