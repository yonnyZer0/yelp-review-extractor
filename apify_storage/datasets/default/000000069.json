  "description": "Went to Pink Onion for my husbands birthday. Had such a great time and of course the pizza was delicious. I'm from NYC and I think I know good pizza but this is definitely one of the best pizza restaurants in town. The owner Frank is so friendly and super accommodating. Will definitely be going back soon.",
