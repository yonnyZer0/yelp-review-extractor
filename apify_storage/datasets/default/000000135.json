  "description": "A great little place not far from Kensington Palace. Warm, cozy and inviting. After reading the reviews I had to try it before dashing off to the airport. They open at 6pm, so I called at 5:30, said I was one, and it was no problem. I was the first person in the door and was welcomed and seated and we got started right away. Fiona explained the menu with gusto and a no-nonsense confidence. I started with the fig and goat cheese salad. Light, tasty, beautifully dressed. Next I opted for the famous Chicken Kiev, which was perfectly\nexecuted. The chicken was fried perfectly, juicy on the inside, with a beautiful garlic butter sauce oozing out from the inside. Did have room for dessert.\n\nDon't miss it if you are in the area. Make sure you book, this place is hot!",
