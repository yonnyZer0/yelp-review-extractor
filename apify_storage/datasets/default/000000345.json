  "description": "Stopped in on a rainy night and glad I did.  Nice beer selection on tap went for a tasty Victoria Prima Pils.  I had already eaten but couldn't resist the Sicilian inspired menu.  Went light with the Olib bruschetta and it was fantastic- the sweetness of the fig preserves perfectly complemented the saltiness of the high quality prosciutto.  Bread was toasted on point and the goat cheese coating it provided an excellent base for the other ingredients.  I saw numerous pizzas abs good looking pasta dishes floating by in server hands.  I'll definitely be back for those!  Matt and Frankie provided excellent service and the low key funky vibe of the Pink Onion is a perfect fit for the North Mission hood.  This place is a keeper whether you want a reasonable lunch, a few happy hour microbrews or a solid Italian meal at dinner.  Well done being open for only a short time.  Mangia bene!",
