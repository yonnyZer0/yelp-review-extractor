  "description": "I don't get the hype. Maybe we ordered the wrong items. We ate here for brunch and found it to be lackluster at best. Boring, overpriced french toast, and some bland, dry, fried chicken dish that tasted like it could have come from a fast food joint. This was not great food and not worth the wait.",
