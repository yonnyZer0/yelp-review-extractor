  "description": "Haven't been to too many places in the city, but enjoyed the heck out of myself here. We had reservations at 4:30 and it was only us and one other party of 4. All the staff were very friendly, and gave us bread and some vermouth to start us off. I got the Tyson Punch Out and she got the Pappardelle Bolognese. Both dishes were extremely satisfying, as was the service!",
