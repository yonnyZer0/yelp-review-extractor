  "description": "Found this little gem on yelp and I'm so glad I did! Owner is super nice and offered us complimentary vermouth when we got there. To start we got their GS salad which was really refreshing and had a really nice citrus dressing. Next we had the bruschetta which was on point and the fire starter pizza which was served w a chili oil that had the perfect amount of spice. Every bite was amazing and you know what was the icing on the cake? Literally cake. Actually tiramisu. Melt in your mouth good, and again another sweet treat from the awesome owner! Can't wait to go back.",
