  "description": "I'm writing this over a month after I ate here because I thought about the sfincione, and I actually got a little emotional. \nThe guys that run the place are true gentlemen, and treated my girlfriend and I like royalty. We had 2 amazing pies, the two most Sicilian ones on the menu. The chef almost tried to talk us out of ordering the sfincione because it's so different from a regular pizza, but I'm glad he didn't. It was truly incredible. \nI will make a point of stopping at Pink Onion every time I'm in San Francisco for as long as they're there.",
