  "description": "This lady in picture is racist. I am Asian. And I waited in the queue for the long time, but she only let others white people or family to go inside ( I know some didn't book) but let me alone. Even worse, a Middle East woman didn't make a reservation but came later than me but she let her in but ignored me and told me that there were no vacancy. We waited close to the door, but some other customers came in and there we're still gaps in the door, she was mad about that and shouted at me and my friends to close my door. Is this my responsibility to help you close the door if it's caused by others lady? If you want your customers to close the door. Why don't you be polite and I will feel more comfortable. This experience made me sad and disappointed, I wonder why where were still some people live in their small and unreasonable discrimination world？\n中国人不要来。这个餐厅服务员搞歧视。让中东人排在我们后面的还有白人先进（他们都是没有预约的），让我和我的朋友等了很久还不让我们坐下。告诉我们没有位子了。然后门是关不紧的，别人进来门没关好漏风，不是我们的问题，还很凶地让我帮她关上。服务态度极差！",
