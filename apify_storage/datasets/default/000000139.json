  "description": "Food 5 // Ambiance 5 // Service 5 \n\nThis place was on my eye from the second I stepped into London. This is a tiny little spot so definitely reserve well ahead of time! Luckily, since I was a solo traveller, I was seated promptly. The owner of the restaurant is not only cooking and serving, but adding her flair to the ambiance of Ffiona's. She embodies the restaurant and you can see her love and passion in the food, decor, and warmth of the restaurant. \n\nThe food was simple, delicious and fresh! The drinks menu was quite unique. I got a lychee and prosecco drink -- so refreshing! ALSO GET THE STICKY TOFFEE -- the best I have ever had!",
