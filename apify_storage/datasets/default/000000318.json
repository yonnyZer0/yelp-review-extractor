  "description": "We've been here a couple of times now for dinner, and can't get enough! The owners are always so pleasant and attentive. Needless to say, the service is superb! Moving on to the food, my partner and I, we LOVE the pappardelle bolognese. It's sooo good! Like really good. We've also had their pink onion salad, side meatballs, Pink Alarm pizza and Icetank pizza. All very yummy!! Everything is made-to-order so it comes out hot, which I appreciate when dining out. Oh, and did I mention they have (good) wine on tap?! YES! I think we've tried them all, don't judge. Lol \n\nLooking forward to our next date night here!",
