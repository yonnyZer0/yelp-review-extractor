  "description": "Our favorite meal after 5 days in London. Highly recommend making a reservation. We walked in without one and got lucky because someone had just cancelled. The place is small and intimate, warm and inviting. Ffiona is friendly, and you can tell the locals go here. We started with the King Prawns which were delicious and flavorful. The chicken kiev is amazing, one of the best things I've ever eaten. We also got the steak and kidney pie which did not disappoint. The mash and greens were great too. No complaints and would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, hearty dinner in London.",
