  "description": "Found Ffiona's through Yelp. We were lucky that it was less than a mile from our hotel. Decided to eat here on our last night in London and we were not disappointed. Made a reservation for 7:00 pm on a Thursday and it was pretty empty when we came. We ordered the scallops, king prawns, vegetable soup, pork chops, chicken kiev and sticky toffee pudding. Everything was delicious! My daughter loved the king prawns! Service was nice and fast. The servers were friendly. The place was homey and casual yet elegant at the same time. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious and satisfying meal.",
