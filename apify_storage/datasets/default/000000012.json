  "description": "This was our first dinner in London and we did not regret it at all. We had curious beer and a mixed drink. We started with scallops and they were devoured and melted in your mouth. I ordered the lamb with mash and my husband ordered veal with butternut squash. The lamb was so delicate and paired well with the mash. The veal with mushroom sauce was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. Bread was served with butter as well.\n\nWe also ordered the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and mocha cake with whipped cream. It was a magnificent way to end dinner.\n\nWe also ordered mint tea and a black coffee. The mint tea was real mint and it was perfect.\n\nThe service matched the exquisite spot and we were served by Ffiona herself. What an awesome experience to meet the owner of the place. It is definitely a local and charming spot.",
