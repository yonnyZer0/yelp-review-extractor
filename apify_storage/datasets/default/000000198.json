  "description": "A slice of heaven \nThe reviews don't lie, this place is a gem.\n\nI came in on a Wednesday and had no problem finding a seat. \n\nThe small Tyson punch out was enough to feed two people. Prepare to have leftovers if you're ordering more than one. \n\nThe ingredients are fresh and the family (family owned biz) is welcoming. For you by Italians!\n\nI will come back and explore the menu. \n\nThe beer and wine selection was great as was the ambience.",
