  "description": "I did a meetup event there yesterday with about 15 people. The venue was small but very quaint. The food was great. I think I like the pasta even more than the pizza. The staff was so friendly and accommodating; they really made us feel welcome. Most of us drank, ate, socialized and stayed for 2-3 hours last night. Good times! This is definitely your \"friendly neighborhood restaurant & bar.\"",
