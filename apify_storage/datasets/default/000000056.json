  "description": "Excellent. We stopped by here for dinner after arriving at our hotel. Happy this was our first meal in London.  I had house wine and chicken Kiev. They mistakenly brought me the chicken roast and at the moment I thought \"huh this must be what I ordered\" and started eating.  A few minutes later the waitress realized the mix up and bought me the kiev anyway. Both dishes were amazing and I finished both entrees . My friend ordered fish and chips with a soup starter and cocktail. Again all excellent.  At this point we were stuffed but had to order dessert. We got the sticky toffee pudding and fresh strawberry cream dish. Both had us drooling. We definitely overt ate and will be back for another visit before we leave the city.",
