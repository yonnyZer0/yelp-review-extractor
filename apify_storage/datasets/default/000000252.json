  "description": "This is truly a neighborhood gem! The menu is small, but mighty. I've eaten here twice and both times were excellent. The service was exceptional and so was the food. I highly recommend trying their limited quantity Sicilian pies if they're available. The crust is fluffy and flavorful, but not overly doughy. Avoid a wait by heading here for an early dinner, otherwise the place is quite cozy and can fill up quickly.",
