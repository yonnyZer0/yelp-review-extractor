  "description": "BEST I EVER HAD.\n\nNothing beats a fun, casual, cute, place that serves some of the best wine, beer, pizza and pasta in SF. I was lucky to have tried Pink Onion during a recent Yelp event but had meaning to go much before that. I'm still drooling over all the amazing dishes we tried. Each were made with lots of love and amazing ingredients. \n\nI, of course, have since told all my friends and coworkers how much this places rocks. So I plan to be back multiple times . It's the perfect place to spend an evening without crazy crowds.\n\nMy favorite part? THEY HAVE AN TV!!!! Hello football sundays!!!",
