  "description": "Stopped by late on a Sunday night for dinner. Ordered a small Icetank (meatball) pizza and a glass of red wine. Also tasted a splash of white vermouth and port, as an apertif and digestif, respectively. The pizza hit the spot -- the meatball was awesome and the crust was perfect -- not too thin, not to thick. Portions were generous -- I left stuffed and took 2 slices home for later. If you like Long Bridge Pizza in the Dogpatch, I think you'd like the pizza at Pink Onion also, both really excellent.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a small unassuming place like this to be an upscale dining experience, but it felt that way. Apparently the proprietors have experience working at Quince, Cotogna, and Lo Coco's, some of the best Italian restaurants in the Bay Area, and it shows. Will definitely be back in the near future to try the pasta!",
