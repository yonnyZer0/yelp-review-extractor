  "description": "Recently got the Yelp email listing Pink Onion as a new opening and the pix looked so tasty we planned an evening out for August birthdays. Party of five and everyone left full and happy. Couple of salads, several pizzas and the side meatballs. Good wine and beer options too for a small place. Very friendly and helpful staff and didn't feel rushed even if we probably hung around talking too long. We'll be back.",
