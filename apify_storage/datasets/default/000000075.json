  "description": "After a looong day of walking and some chilly winds, nothing hit the spot like Pink Onion. We swung by on a Thursday night around 9 and had no issues with waiting. \n\n5/5 service: our waitress was quick to seat, serve, and deliver the check. Appreciate that it was easy to holler for some assistance! \n\n4/5 pizza: we had the truffle mushroom pizza and, while it was delicious, it wasn't spectacularly amazing compared to the cheaper options. For ~$22 (one size, 8 slices?), it served two not-so-hungry people. I'd come back, but it won't be my first pizza craving.",
