  "description": "Yelp pushed about 50 reviews off of the front page (you have to click on \"read reviews that are not recommended\" at the bottom) for some reason, so here's a copy & paste of my recent experience here because these guys deserve the attention.\n\nSome of the best pizza I've had on the peninsula. Not foofy and woodfired/coalfired, not just plain ol' pizza - just perfect pizza crust similar to Pauline's. It's a small space so try it before it gets popular because, as of now, they're flying under the radar.",
