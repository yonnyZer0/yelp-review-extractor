  "description": "Straight to the food: Not good full stop. \n\nThe sauce was very acidic The cheese tasted cheap and had a rubbery mouth feel. \n\nThe worst of all was the crust. It looked and tasted like an old school Pizza Hut pie.  I guess cardboard would be the best way to describe the taste and texture.  With a healthy helping of grease for good measure.  It tasted massed produced I would not be surprised if they got the dough shipped in from an outside vendor. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm no snob I'll crush a frozen pizza and I have had my fair share of chain pizza.  However a small pizza for $20 at this \"fine Italian cuisine\" resturant as they describe it is a grand mis-representation.  I am Sicilian and spent every summer there until I was 18. This is not southern Italian not even close. \n\nThis is drunk food at best.......very very drunk food. \n\n\nPS: the meatballs are inedible",
