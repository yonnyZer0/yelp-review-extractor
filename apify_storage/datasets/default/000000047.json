  "description": "Fellow Yelpers are spot on. We liked Ffiona's so much we went back two days later. Tiny space belies breadth of culinary skill. The food is farm to table, but the skill with which it is cooked provides the diner with something that is so much more. Fresh Dover scallops on a purée of local dark greens - wonderful. Cornish hake - delicious. Scottish sirloin - to die for. Apple and blueberry crumble with custard - just about over the top. Don't pass this up!",
