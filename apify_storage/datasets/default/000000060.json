  "description": "Love this cute little place! We came here on a beautiful Sunday morning for breakfast. The waitress was welcoming & quick to get us taken care of. The owner was there and she is just a peach! So sweet & attentive our entire sitting. Both ladies are just lovely & always made sure to check in on us. They genuinely care for their customers & service. We had the special of the day which was poached eggs w/ a homemade red hummus of some sort which was so delicious. Also the dish w/ eggs, sausage, bacon & 2 cafe lattes. Highly recommend Fiona's & hope to come back again one day :)",
