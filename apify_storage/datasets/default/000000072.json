  "description": "Service was pretty slow here. There are five of us and the waiter brought 2 pieces of bread and Jane i asked for more he brought one piece. Not classy.\nAnd the food took wayyyyyyy too long to come out which probably impacted my enjoyment. It's a low key place but I wouldn't try again. Pizza was meh. Not a fan.",
