  "description": "First of all, make a reservation!\nSecond, British food is delicious over there!\n\nThe place is nice, Fiona is extra nice and the food is really good!\nIf you need any help they will explain everything you need to know before you order. \nThe place is charming and lovely with lights coming out of candles.\nAt first we thought it was a bit pricey but with this quality of food and compare to others restaurants, it's definitely not that pricey!\nIf you are looking to end a day nicely, this is the place to go to.\nPS : the chicken Kiev is a must try",
