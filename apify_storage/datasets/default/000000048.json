  "description": "This place is fantastic. It is a wonderful place because there is a good atmosphere and tasty dishes are served. This place relaxes me with a magic design: many clocks, flowers, books and  others nice details.\nWhen I want to be alone, it is  the perfect place. I like to order in this restaurant a Latte  and Prawn&grilles avocado - these are very delicious. \nI'm in love with this place!",
