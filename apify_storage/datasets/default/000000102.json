  "description": "Man, this place made me have so many feelings about pizza that I didn't know were possible.\n\nI've never really been into \"fancy\" pizza -- I usually reserve it for the nights where I'm desperate for food or just need some quick greasy satisfaction.\n\nBut Pink Onion changes everything. Pink Onion is art. \n\nI will wholeheartedly say Pink Onion is the best pizza I've had in my life.\n(Ok, I haven't been to Italy before, so maybe my opinion doesn't matter. But my friends who *have* been agreed this place was really damn good.)\n\nI usually stick to the Magic Mushroom pizza (it's not *too* mushroom-y, and the black truffles on top are amazing), but every pizza on the menu seems solid. Try the Sicilian style pizzas for something a little different!\n\nThe staff here is wonderful and I love how excited they are about their food --Â it's always a pleasure to come back here.\n\n(Pro tip: the Sangiovese on the menu goes unbelievably well with pizza. Like, they were made to be together.)",
