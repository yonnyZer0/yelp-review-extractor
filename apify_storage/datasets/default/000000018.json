  "description": "We had a lovely dinner here for our last night in London. As soon as you step in, it feels like you're eating at a friend's house. My husband ate the Chicken Kiev (delicious!) and I had the traditional fish 'n chips. Everything was so delicious and fresh, and reasonably priced. This is a definite must!",
