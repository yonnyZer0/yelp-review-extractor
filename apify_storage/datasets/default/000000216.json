  "description": "Super cozy space! It feels like you're sitting in Ffiona's living room. Called in earlier in the afternoon and booked a table for 5. Food definitely feels homemade and is mostly delicious! I especially loved the fish dish that I got to try from my friend. Ffiona seems super friendly too.",
