  "description": "This is a great spot for a quality neighborhood pie. The service was as good as the pizzas and we both left smiling and full. The Tyson was delicious as was the pesto pizza. Ohh and the tomatoes and burrata in the Caprese were as fresh as they come. I'll be coming back as soon as I can!",
