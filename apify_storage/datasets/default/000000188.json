  "description": "The pizza of the month: \"the magic mushroom\" olive oil, black pepper, mozzarella, crimini mushrooms, prosciutto di parma & bianchett truffle! So good! Must have! Gotta have it, gotta get it! And the staff is friendly and the food was brought so quickly! What more can I say about this place? Parking may be a challenge so come early. It can get really busy so be ready to wait, or order take out",
