  "description": "Amazing staff handled our group of 20 with an unflappable attitude and tons of patience.  The bill was about 1/2 of what was expected.  Great service and really great pizza, will definitely come again.\n\nI called an hour after they closed the night before, frantically trying to schedule a place for 20 people.  They were very accommodating, and assured me there would be no issue.  Sure enough, without a hitch!",
