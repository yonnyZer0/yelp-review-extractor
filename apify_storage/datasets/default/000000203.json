  "description": "Bottom line: Really good food with REALLY bad attitude that seems to be the owner's \"shtick\"\n\nThe good: The food. Everything we ordered was top notch. I cannot deny that; from salads, to starters to entrees. \n\nThe bad: Please check my reviews. I go out enough. I have never commented negatively on service. Ffiona's attitude is nothing short of insulting to the point it made us wonder if she had some sort of bigotted bias against Americans (?), Jews (?), people with children (!!!). The place has a note on the door stating it is child friendly. It is not. There are no high chairs. There is little tolerance for childish misbehavior. The owner and her employee were impolite to us. We were not offered deserts at the end of our meal to make sure we rush out to allow others to be seated. We were not presented the full range of options when we were seated (we know, because others in the restaurant received better care).",
