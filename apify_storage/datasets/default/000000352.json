  "description": "This place is the Jam! We discovered it on yelp after arriving at another fancy pizza place that was out of dough at 830 on a Saturday! Ugh! \n\nWhat a fantastic find! First week open. Still getting the kinks out. Food is a grand slam success! Nice and small spot. 8 tables or so and about 10 can sit at the bar. The food is really really top notch. The service is acceptable. Beer and wine only. Nice selection. Pizza was some of the best I've ever had! Good luck guys!",
