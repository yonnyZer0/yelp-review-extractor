  "description": "Absolutely delightful restaurant.  Food, ambiance, service all outstanding.  In the last 10 days we have dined there twice, the first just trying it out and the second because it was so good.  Ffiona herself adds to the evening by occasionally sitting down and chatting. And given the intimacy of the restaurant you chat with a nearby table.  It just added to the overall experience.  Highly recommend Ffiona's",
