  "description": "Sometimes you stumble upon a restaurant and it surprises you in its perfection. We walked in 20 minutes before closing, and the owners couldn't have been more welcoming. The pizza is hands down as good as my two other favorites, Pizzahacker and Emilia's in Emeryville. And at the end of the meal, when they could have been rushing us out as it was past closed, we were offered a shot of vermouth. An amazingly delicious and fresh pie (and salad), easy parking and friendly owners should easily put Pink Onion at the top of the SF pizza food chain.",
