  "description": "This little place is AMAZING! Seriously, this is the place to visit when in London. I had the Queen scramble and my goodness it was so delicious. I was feeling a little crazy so I also ordered the French toast. Please you guys need to try the French toast. Never in my life have I ever had anything so good! The fruit was fresh and sweet.",
