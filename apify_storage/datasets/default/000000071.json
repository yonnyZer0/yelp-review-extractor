  "description": "My wife and I ate here recently. It is a small cute restaurant that we decided to try after craving some pizza mid week.\n\nThe pizza was pretty good, better than a lot of places we've had, so we enjoyed it. \n\nThe reason for 3 stars is due to the service. They are a small restaurant and I would guess that I can only bake one pizza at a time. That's fine, no problem! The problem is that my wife and I each ordered a pizza. Mine came in a reasonable amount of time, but my wife's came at least 20 minutes later. The problem I have with this is that we saw at least 6 pizzas go out for take out between when I got my pizza and when my wife got hers. You would think that the restaurant would prioritize an eat-in table (especially when one of the guests was served already) as opposed to prioritizing take out orders. \n\nThey did know that the second pizza was taking a long time, so they comped us two dessert wines (without us asking or complaining). A nice gesture, but we would have preferred our two pizzas at roughly the same time :)\n\nThe person filling water was ON IT though, so kudos for that!",
