  "description": "Fun little place for really good pizza and some pasta. Gets a little loud when crowded but service was charming and once the big groups left it was peaceful. We tried the meatballs, the pasta bolognese and the pink fire alarm pizza. The pasta was great, the meatballs delicious and the pizza was very tasty with a crusty that was crispy and chewy in the right amounts. Will be back.",
