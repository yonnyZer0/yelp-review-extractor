  "description": "What an adorable & delicious spot. We walked in off the street, not realizing reservations were the norm. We should have known, considering the perfect 5-star rating on Yelp that drew us in in the first place. We were disappointed and almost turned to leave, when Fiona herself said there was a gap in reservations and if we could eat and be done in 1.5 hours, the table was ours! Easy! So we did. I ordered the fish & chips, and my wife ordered the chicken kiev. Both were such simple dishes and we didn't expect to be blown away - and yet! We both left our plates so clean the dishwasher may have wondered if they had even been used. We also had the Parmesan salad, which again, was amazingly simple but supreme. My pregnant wife also loved her elderflower mocktail. It was one of those meals where you aren't let down by even one thing - and so, Fiona's 5-star rating is obviously earned and well deserved. Fiona herself stopped by our table for a chat, and we couldn't be happier to be supporting her business. Such a lovely, genuine person. If you're in the area, make sure you make this one of your stops. We stayed in Kensington for 9 days and ate our way through the entire area. This was by far the best and most memorable meal of them all! Thanks again Fiona!",
