  "description": "WHY IS NO ONE REVIEWING THE AMAZING PINK ALARM FIRE PIZZA?! Seriously one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  It is like a pepperoni pizza but with delicious roasted garlic flavor and just spicy enough to get your mouth watering for the next bite.  I order this pizza at least once a month - it is a staple in our delivery rotation.  Always better eaten hot and fresh at the restaurant but when your kid goes to bed at 6:30pm and you want something delicious but have no energy to cook, the pink alarm pizza hits the spot. The pink onion salad is also delish.  Clearly the chef named all the most delicious stuff on the menu \"pink onion\".",
