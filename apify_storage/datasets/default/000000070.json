  "description": "My husband has eaten at Lo Coco's in Berkeley several times and raves about the legit Sicilian food there. I found Pink Onion through Yelp, but we had no idea that Frank from Lo Coco's was also an owner of this place. We had a ton of dishes in our group (listed below), and everything was absolutely amazing. We will be back again and again every time we are in the city. The service was on point as well. Grazie mille! \nI can vouch for all of these dishes:\nPink onion salad\nGreen salad\nMeatballs\nPink alarm fire pizza\nPasta bolognese \nPistachio pesto pasta",
