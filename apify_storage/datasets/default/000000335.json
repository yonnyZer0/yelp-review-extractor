  "description": "Pink Onion is one of those neighborhood places people in the know whisper about, a local gem that once really discovered will crowd up. Go now! The pizza crusts (the wine), the meatballs (the wine), and the sweetly friendly staff (serving ... the wine) make it a place to come back to. Don't keep it a secret though, bring a friend to enjoy the treat with you!",
