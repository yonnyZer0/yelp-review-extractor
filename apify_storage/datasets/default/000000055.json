  "description": "- strongly recommend making reservations as the place is small and popular, 12 or less tables, intimate, walk ins welcome (but likely a wait)\n- friendly staff \n- welsh lamb was cooked perfectly, well dressed and tender\n- sirloin steak w/ a side of new potatoes was comfortable; something you'd make at home but without the effort of having to cook it yourself \n- daily menu changes (written on a blackboard), \n- we just missed the last order of scallops but they looked amazing\n- will return during my next visit, would be a regular if I lived nearby\n- farm to table\n- apple berry crumble and eton mess were both enjoyable",
