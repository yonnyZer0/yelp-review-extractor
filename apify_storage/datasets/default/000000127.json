  "description": "I heard about this place from my friends I finally gave it a try after some shopping in Soho as we passed by this location and the queue.\n\nThey don't take reservations, same as many causal restaurants in London. Be aware of some wait time to eat around London town in Zone 1 (city center) if you are just visiting and not familiar with the local food scene. \n\nThe restaurant has two levels, it's not small but definitely crowded. Tables are quite close to one another, they play hit songs in the background with a causal and friendly hipster vibe. That's how I would describe it.  \n\nThe menu is very simple. The One & Only main item is The iron steak. You might choose  sides and sauce. It comes with a side salad. We liked the fries, creamy spinach, and the horseradish and also peppercorn sauce to accompany the steak. Oh, and not to mention, the meal comes with a cup of warm buttery popcorn .\n\nI am also a sucker on presentation of the food. The little cleaver is a cute touch ! You can purchase it as you wish as well \n\nFor the quality and the price, you really cannot go wrong here! I would say my experience matched up with the hype!",
