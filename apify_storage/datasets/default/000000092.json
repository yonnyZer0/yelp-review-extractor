  "description": "Wonderful place. Food was delicious and server's recommendations were wonderful. Outstanding squid entree was very tender and had a nice little kick from the chilies. Chicken Kiev was certainly the best I've ever had with savoury sauce and perfectly crispy breading. Calcanon and steamed greens were perfect accompaniment. All served promptly and steaming hot. Portions were generous - couldn't finish it all. Had to try the lemon mascarpone cheesecake for dessert, which didn't disappoint. Cozy bistro location, good for couples, business and saw a few families. Will definitely make a point of returning next time I'm in London.",
