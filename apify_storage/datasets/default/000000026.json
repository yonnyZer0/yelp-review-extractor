  "description": "Such a cute date night spot in the Mission! I love coming here with my boyfriend and trying out their various selection of pizza and pastas. My absolute favorites is the Magic Mushroom Pizza and Pesto Pasta. Be sure to order this and you'll thank me later!\n\nPink Onion takes reservations but you shouldn't have high hopes that you'll be seated on time, since this restaurant is small and is always packed. We had a reservation on a Friday evening and didn't get seated until 30 minutes later. The staff was super friendly though and gave us a free bottle of wine for making us wait. I'm not complaining and appreciate the kind gesture! \n\nI really enjoy the ambiance here and it has a cozy and homey feel to it. It really adds to the restaurant charm and the food is just amazing. The pizza crust is homemade and tastes even better dipped into some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. :)",
