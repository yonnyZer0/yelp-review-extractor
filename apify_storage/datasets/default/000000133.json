  "description": "Fantastic food and excellent service. A lovely place to eat home made British dish favorites. We have the chicken Kiev and the fish and chips and they were fantastic. Wonderfully flavored, the breading was perfect. For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and the apple and blueberry crumble. Make time for this stop! We came on a quiet night but I think normally it would be better to have a reservation. We will probably make time to come here again before our trip was over. 5 stars just isn't enough!",
