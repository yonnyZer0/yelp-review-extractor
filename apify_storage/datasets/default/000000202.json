  "description": "Great place owned by Fiona.  The food was delicious.  Chicken kiev was very juicy, and I enjoyed their duck pate.  Prices are also pretty reasonable for a Friday date kind of place.  Atmosphere is cozy and inviting.  Fiona herself is very friendly and will make sure to strike a conversation with you before you leave.  Overall, a lovely experience.",
