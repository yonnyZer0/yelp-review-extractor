  "description": "I'm an obnoxious pizza snob from Chicago, and didn't expect to be bowled over by \"bistro-type fancy schmancy San Fran pie\" oh boy was I wrong! it was fantastic!  FRESH ingredients and herbs and oils and the wine? was great! It's a small place, so call ahead! We were on our way to a concert, and it was perfect for us...NO WAITING at all.  Our server was very attentive and saw to our every need. {AND no one will care, but, there was even a favorite photo of Laurel and Hardy in the women's bathroom}. All of this added up to a delicious gourmet top of the line restaurant disguised as a friendly neighborhood hideaway.",
