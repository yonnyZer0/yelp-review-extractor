  "description": "Not from SF and always trying to find good places to eat. Pink onion is a spot to definitely check out. The food is tasty and authentic. Being from the east coast it is always a challenge to find good pizza/Italian food, but this place exceeded the expectations. Matt, the owner, and his wife are super cute and accommodating. Well earned 5 stars, will definitely be back!",
