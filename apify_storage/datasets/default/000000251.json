  "description": "This was our last meal before our flight back to LA and this spot was a great choice. \n\nFirst off, the two workers at the restaurant at that time were very sweet and helpful. They seemed to genuinely want to enhance our dinner experience. \n\nWe got an order of their meatballs and a half Guido/half Palermo pizza. I enjoyed the pizza. If there's a pizza with arugula and prosciutto, that's what I'll get. This place was generous with the prosciutto and the arugula. I didn't like the dough of the pizza enough to eat the crust, though.\n\nThe meatballs were huge! and very satisfying. They came with some bread that we dipped in the sauce.\n\nOH, one tip I have to add is TRY THE SPICY OLIVE OIL! Pairs AMAZINGLY with the bread. I even sprinkled some on to my pizza. No regrets.",
