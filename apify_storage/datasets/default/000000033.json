  "description": "Checked out this place last Friday night. Was able to get one of the last tables for two without reservations so that was nice. It's also a pretty random part of town, far from most everything else in the Mission so maybe that helped.\n\nThe Magic Mushroom pizza was yummy! Can't go wrong with truffle and prosciutto. The bread/dough itself was really good. The bf ended up asking for more olive oil at the end so he could dip his pizza crusts in it.\n\nJust ordered a L pizza for two, nothing else. Bill came out to be $38 after tip/tax. Cute little neighborhood place, it was fun to try.",
