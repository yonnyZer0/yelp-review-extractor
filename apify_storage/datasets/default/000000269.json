  "description": "Cozy little nook for pizza. Nice selection of beer and wine, and they give you a nice generous pour. Boss also gave me a free taste of white vermouth just to warm the palate up which was a classy touch ! I got the Kamoute pizza and added sausage to it. Good taste, but too much arugula was added(I had to dig just to see the actual pizza. \n\nThe size of the small pizza is very generous as well, so you're getting your money's worth at 20$ a pop. Overall will come here again !",
