  "description": "Lovely restaurant that I enjoyed with my daughter at the beginning of our sprint through Europe. We traipsed through Buckingham Palace earlier - wouldn't turn down a meal there, but the home folks seem pretty uptight.\n\nNot so at Ffiona's and the smashing people and food. Our charming server Fatima and the owner's very helpful sister took lovely care of us. The chicken Kiev and roast lamb were delish and the variety of veggies was the bomb. We finished with Blueberry crumble and we're off to Paris. Is there anything to eat there?",
