  "description": "Move over Zero Zero, Pink Onion is my new favorite pizza place! I checked out Pink Onion a few weeks ago and the food and drinks here are delicious, and service is fantastic. My girlfriend and I ordered the meatballs and the margherita pizza to share and we left stuffed. The meatballs are super juicy, and flavorful and the freshly grated cheese on top is a nice touch. I thought Tony's in North Beach served great meatballs, but Pink Onions are superior in my opinion. Margherita pizzas are my go-to pizza whenever I can get it, and I can confidently say that Pink Onion nailed the crust, sauce, and the cheese. 10/10 would come back again.",
