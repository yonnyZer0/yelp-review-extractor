  "description": "Could not recommend this restaurant enough! My family and I came for the Thanksgiving dinner and every part of the meal was unbelievably delicious. They even allowed a specific request for us: Pumpkin Pie! Accommodating for vegetarians and very friendly and open, an amazing experience we'll never forget.",
