  "description": "The food in this restaurant, run by a Welsh woman, is extraordinary. We had a squid appetizer that was so good we were seriously considering ordering the dish again at  the same meal.  Wine and cocktails are excellent. Service is solid.  Setting is homey and sweet. Definitely a hit.",
