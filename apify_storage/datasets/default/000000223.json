  "description": "I went to a meeting at the Mission campus of UCSF, which seemed to be located in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately I discovered Pink Onion on Yelp, which was a few blocks away. A few of us headed there for dinner. Thankfully it wasn't too crowded. There were some tables along the left-side wall and bar seating. Love the chill and swanky vibe as we sat down at the bar and ordered a few beers. The bartender was really sweet.\n\nThe menu looked very minimal. The pizzas were made with simple ingredients. There was a burrata pizza as part of that week's specials, so we decided to share that, and it was amazing. Fresh and delicious. The top corner of their menu says that their restaurant reflects \"authentic casual fine dining\" and I couldn't agree more. If you're in the Mission and looking for good pizza, look no further than the Pink Onion!",
