  "description": "Exceptional restaurant with outstanding food and great, neighborhood feel.  Fun, excellent service with personality.  We had a duck pate appetizer, homemade, delicious, very good cocktails--a Negroni and a Pimms with cucumber and fruit, the spectacular veal chop and a swordfish with a homemade green spicy mayo that might have been better.  Outstanding sauces, perfectly cooked food, great neighborhood atmosphere and, for London, moderate price.  Can't ask for more!",
