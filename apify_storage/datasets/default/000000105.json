  "description": "Grub hub delivery to my hotel. Went perfectly and the pizza was sublime. Exactly what we wanted, good quality well made pizza. Fresh ingredients and great taste. Crust was bubbly and golden brown. We got 2 smalls one Margherita and one with pepperoni, green onion and lemon zest or oil. It was very tasty. It was great for two adults and 2 kids. Small is 12-14\" pie.",
