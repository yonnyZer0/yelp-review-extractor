  "description": "This place was so good it has prompted my first ever Yelp review. If you are debating between this place and somewhere else, stop that nonsense and JUST GO HERE! Pink Onion's food was absolutely delicious! They weren't stingy with their potions AT ALL and I left with a huge smile on my face and a full belly! Not only is their food the bomb but their staff is the friggin best! Attentive, friendly, helpful and they made the experience and absolute pleasure! They wanted us to feel at home and we really did! The ambiance is adorable and it feels like a modern Italian caf√©. Just trust me, GO HERE! Eat your little heart out and enjoy amazing food and service",
