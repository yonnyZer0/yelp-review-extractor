  "description": "Nice little restaurant. It is small with only 5 tables and they fill up fast with reservations. I was able to secure one seat for myself on a Thursday night about 7pm. But she turned away everyone else that came in because of reservations. \n\nNice assortment of menu items. I was searching for fish & chips to eat and they had it. This was very good. Wine and cocktail selection is great. Beer selection was very small. \n\nStaff was exceedingly friendly. It was like I was eating in her own house. Fun place.",
