  "description": "I had been to pink onion before and loved it. However, I brought another friend here today, and we took a few slices of left over pizza home. My friend found a snail shell in the pizza and had to spit it out. Pretty disappointing - I'll likely not come here again. Hopefully we didn't inadvertently eat some snail :-(",
