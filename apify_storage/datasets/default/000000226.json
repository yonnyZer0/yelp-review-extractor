  "description": "We had dinner last night at The Pink Onion and everything was Top Notch. We have eaten here numerous times and have never been disappointed. We started with a special Carbonara and it was delish. We then had the Pink Onion Salad which was equally delectable. We finished with the Palermo Pizza. The crust was perfectly done and the toppings were great. The owners are so nice and they really go out of there way to make you feel at home. They took really good of us. The Pink Onion is a fabulous neighborhood Italian Restaurant. We highly recommend you try it.",
