  "description": "Came here for my second time with the Mrs. (her first) and was happy to see this fun little gastropub/italian joint really taking off. The servers are prompt, friendly, hilarious and give nice pours on their wine ;). The food is as good as it gets. We had the meatballs appetizer which tasted spectacular (they're made in house, i asked), the sauteed romaine which is full of garlic, spice and everything nice. The pesto pistachio pasta is cooked to al dente perfection, with a pesto sauce that has you begging for more. And the pizza of choice was the Tyson Punch Out which i kept dreaming about the next day at work. The moral of the story is: GO HERE, YOU WONT REGRET IT. \n\n(PS. They have a tv and a lot great wine and beers on tap)",
