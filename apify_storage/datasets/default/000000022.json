  "description": "Went there for the first time this past week. Cute little place, pizza tasted great, service was friendly and fast. I was definitely going to come back. Unfortunately, I don't think I will ever be back now. Took leftovers home with me, ate one slice back home, and found a snail shell while chewing. Probably from the Arugula they put on the pizza....a shocking first for me and scary given the meningitis causing parasites that live in snails. I called them to let them know - some person (chef? manager?) chuckled and said it sounds kind of funny and offered to send me another pizza. \"Absolutely not!\" was my answer.\n\nThey need to double and triple wash their produce. Better yet, please buy it triple washed.",
