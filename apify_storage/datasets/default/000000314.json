  "description": "Adorable new place with amazing attentive staff and great food!!!! Portions are nice and quality is all there. I had the Bruschetta and it was delicious! Toasted to perfection with the perfect amount of toppings. It was followed by a pasta with Bolognese. Cooked AL DENTE! Just the way I like it. Nice meat sauce, not too salty and..... truffles! For dessert I was treated to probably one of the best and lightest and delicious Tiramisu desserts. It was absolutely perfect. I also got some great little drink samples!!! Super plus! \n\nThe space is not huge. It got an artsie-modern feel but it's cozy and very welcoming. It's got a TV and the game was on!!! Nice. \n\nThey don't skimp on their wine pours or desserts. I'm really digging this spot and can't wait to tell all my friends at the General about it so we can come grab some after work bites and drinks!!! \n\nParking is easy and although it's hidden of the main road, I'd say it's worth seeking out! \n\nGreat new find!",
