  "description": "Went through Yelp reservations... confirmed through Yelp messaging   Arrived with family 25 minutes ahead of schedule    The reservation for 4 was for 7pm   It is 7.30 pm and they still have no table for us   They clearly over book tables here and look totally clueless when you show up as per a reservation confirmation   First time evet for us   Best way to ruin a family event   Come here!! Increased rating to 3 stars as they finally seated us and the food was very good indeed and they gave a nice discount on bill  ... however they should not be taking reservations   They have barely 4-5 tables and if one party stays toi long, they just cannot do anything",
