  "description": "Great restaurant with friendly staff. Try the fish and chips. However the steak with garlic butter was one of the best steaks I've ever had. A sticky toffee for dessert is a great finisher along with \"the mess\" which is a strawberry sundae with whip cream it is amazing and should be eaten by everyone.",
