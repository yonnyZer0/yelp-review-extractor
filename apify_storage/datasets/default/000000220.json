  "description": "It is like home cooked food with a twist of good side dishes. Very tasty side dishes . Better than the sirloin. If you go here go for the fish or the duck. Side dishes are all good but coctails are not so much. Rose wine was sparling and any sparkling wine is not real wine. Go for the starters, side dishes and fish. They are all very tasty. Cosy little place and it is not cheap. Very warm owner, nice people.",
