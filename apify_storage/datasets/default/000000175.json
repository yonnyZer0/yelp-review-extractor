  "description": "Charming restaurant, but warm since there was no a/c on! The restaurant has a nice selection of meal options and lots of interesting, but familiar items to choose from. It was hard to selection my main course. She had this avocado appetizer that was just scrumptious and lots of amazing side dishes that were just fabulous! My main dish was fish and it too was spectacular. I would definitely go back. There were lots of regulars there and the place is hopping!",
