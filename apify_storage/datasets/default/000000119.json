  "description": "Omg, where do I start. First off, the owners are super sweet and friendly. They really make you feel welcome. More importantly, the food is incredible! We had the vegetarian burrata plate (drool). Seriously, it was one of the better dishes we've had. I loved the blueberries and candied pears in the dish...divine! We also fell in love with their pesto pasta dish and magic mushroom pizza. Great wine selection as well. We are totally coming back (and will be regulars for sure). Thank you for such an incredible meal, Pink Onion!!!",
