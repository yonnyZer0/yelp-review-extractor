  "description": "It's right next to the OfficeMax and somehow we never discovered it!!! Their bread is divine, hot fresh and somehow so savory and has layers of taste and texture to it. I pretty much got full on the bread cuz they are so good with olive oil, but we ordered magic mushroom pizza. The portion is HUGE. The pizza is one of the best I have had :') the tomato sauce tasted like it's fresh crushed out of a very flavorful tomato. 10/10 would order take out and come back again. Service is also on point. Great beer too.",
