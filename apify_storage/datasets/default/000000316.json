  "description": "This place is amazing! The two friends that run the place have been in the food industry in the bay area their whole lives, so they cook with the finest ingredients and pay close attention to everything they make. They're also amazing hosts and love to chat if you sit at the bar. I've been 3 times so far and each time they do something special. Once I couldn't decide on which Bruschetta to order and so they brought me a sampler with all 3! They've also made off the menu seasonal bruschetta with whatever great fresh ingredients they just got in. \n\nI recommend the Pistachio Pesto for pasta and for pizza: Tyson Punch Out and Guido. \n\nThey also have a great rotating selection of local craft beers and some hard to find brews, like the German lager Kostritzer Black (Schwartzbier).\n\nIn addition, they have great local wines on tap; so it's always fresh. No liquor.\n\nThey even have a fantastic Vermouth, Tenuta Tamburnin, which I recommend asking for a taste of!\n\nCozy space, probably holds 30. Several tables. Nice bar with ~10 chairs.",
