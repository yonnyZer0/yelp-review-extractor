  "description": "The pizza gods have spoken. This is it folks. We ordered the truffle bruschetta and the guido pizza....wow!!! To top it we had ipas on tap. Sigh...the pizza...the textures, flavors and crust alll on point! It's an expensive pie but totally worth every penny. We ate in and heard multiple Uber eats orders going in and out. I can't wait to be back!!",
