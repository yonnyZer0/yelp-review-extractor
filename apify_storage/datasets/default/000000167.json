  "description": "I was swayed by the ratings to have dinner on August 10th, the food was very good except my pork chop was undercooked.  I can count on one hand the times I have sent back food and this is one of them.  The chef apologized and cooked it to the correct temperature.  All great until I called back the next day to check on a hat I had left.\n\nThe sister working the night before answered and was very nice, said \"they had found a hat\", and to stop by after 6pm (August 11th...today) to pick it up.  She then called me later today and said the hat was no longer there and suggested it was not the same color as mine, but she'd call me back if another hat was found.\n\nHere's why I am writing this post...I just called to check if anything was found, as I'm flying home (to the US) tomorrow.  The other sister (working tonight...August 11th) answered, and while she was initially indifferent, she ultimately became hostile and suggested I was implying they stole my hat.  I was surprised by her hostility, by her lack of concern and by her complete lack of customer service.  I had her on speaker phone, so my wife and daughter heard the conversation from our hotel room, both were \"shocked\".\n\nI am well travelled and have eaten at many restaurants all over the world...my recommendation is to avoid this restaurant...at least on the night this sister is working!  Actually, she appeared to be the owner/manager, so I'd avoid it on all nights!!",
