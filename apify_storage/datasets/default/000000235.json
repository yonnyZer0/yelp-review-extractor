  "description": "Pink onion!!! I absolutely love this place. My first time here I had their pink onion margarita pizza and it was delicious!!\n\nBut my second visit here is what really captivated me. The owners are great! They are very personable and really made sure we were having a pleasant experience. \n\nThe servers were wonderful too. Very attentive. \n\nWe ordered the Bolgonese which was so flavorful! And the Tyson's punch out pizza had some of the best crust ever! \n\nI would highly recommend this place if you're looking for great Italian food with a cozy atmosphere :)",
