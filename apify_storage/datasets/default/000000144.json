  "description": "Just got to san fran after a 7 hour drive! Amazing food great music super cute interior. I got the pink fire alarm and my boyfriend got tagliatelle al sugo with meatballs. The meat balls were fantastic and the spicy olive oil on the pizza was a good touch. Super great hole in the wall. The servers were also super nice and all very attentive",
