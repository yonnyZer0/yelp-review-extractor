  "description": "A couple of days late, but yet again, another amazing dinner his past Friday 01 December! Ffiona is the best! Her food literally sings! Since discovering this Kensington gem, I don't have dinner anywhere else whenever I'm in London! Don't delay! Go!\n\n\n\nThis is one of the best spots in London! Ffiona is amazing. She's outstanding at what she does, hence why she's been in business for 24yrs! The food is just like home. Made with love, and full of comfort. Ffiona and her crew welcome you with open arms and treat you like family. Nothing on the menu will disappoint!",
