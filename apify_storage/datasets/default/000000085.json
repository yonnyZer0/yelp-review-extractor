  "description": "Very cute restaurant! The food was incredible! I had fish and chips and my friend had lamb with mashed potatoes. We were torn between the two so we shared. Both entrees were incredible! Our service was great. We opted for 2 desserts: sticky toffee pudding and a custard apple and blueberry crumble! I'm so glad I found this place on yelp. The restaurant has limited seating so be sure to make a reservation. You will not be disappointed",
