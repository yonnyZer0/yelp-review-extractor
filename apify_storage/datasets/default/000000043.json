  "description": "Let me start by saying this - if you have to wait to be seated, WAIT. Ffiona's is the most worth it place ever, and is run by Ffiona herself (who is the sweetest woman).  We were searching high and low for a local spot to have some good brunch... we hit the jackpot with this place. I would highly recommend the eggs Benedict and French Toast (which we ordered with the Waffle toppings). My boyfriend had the full English breakfast which he really enjoyed. It's a cozy, home style, lovely little place and once seated Ffiona and the other waitress are just wonderful. I wanted to order everything on the drink Menu, but we settled for the Machiatto and English breakfast tea. You can really tell a lot of hard work and love goes into this place - will be returning for dinner before the end of our trip!",
