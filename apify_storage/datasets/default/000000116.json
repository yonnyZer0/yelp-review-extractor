  "description": "Ordered delivery. \n\nPrepare yourself for the most decadent pizza. We ordered the Magic Mushroom Pizza. It is incredibly rich and by rich I mean greasy but so delicious. If you like truffle and Prosciutto this is the pizza for you. \n\nIt is a thin crust pizza with a very thick crust. \nUsually my boyfriend and I can finish the whole thing but we were too full/ need to give the liver a break. \n\nWe would order from pink onion again only on cheat days.",
