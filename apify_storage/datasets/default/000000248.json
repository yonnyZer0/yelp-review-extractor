  "description": "Incredible experience at pink onion. Excellent service and the food was amazing. Great selection of tap beers. I had the Palermo pizza which was great with amazing flavor and tasted very fresh. Overall would highly recommend this place if you are looking for great Italian food and a small intimate atmosphere.",
