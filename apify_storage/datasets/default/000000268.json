  "description": "Great pizza, great staff, and great pizza. \n\nWe stumbled upon here after going to Rainbow Grocery, and was blown away at how good the restaurant was. Everything we ordered was 5 stars, and the service was also 5 stars. They were super friendly and answered all of the little questions we had. \n\nReally glad that this place has opened up in the area. One of the best pizza places in the city, IMHO.",
