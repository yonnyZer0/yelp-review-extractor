  "description": "Love, love, love this place! We came here because we were in the area for an event. What an awesome surprise! The food here is amazing and very authentic. The owners / staff here are really wonderful people and were so welcoming & kind towards us! We ate this pizza that had truffle oil, mushrooms & proscuitto on it and we also had the bolognese. Both dishes were out of this world! This is the first time I had bolognese at a restaurant that was as good as my family recipe. The noodles are imported straight from Sicily! Wow!! Oh and they have a really good beer selection too. Such a great experience! We will be coming here again very soon!",
