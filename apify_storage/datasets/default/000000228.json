  "description": "Ordered via UberEats, and Pink Onion is one of their best restaurants in my delivery location. I ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese and the side meatballs, and it was delicious!!! They read my side notes, i.e. provide Parmesan cheese, and didn't miss it like other restaurants. Food is worth the price. I'll likely try the dine-in experience.",
