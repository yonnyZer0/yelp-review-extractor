  "description": "Hidden Gem! When my favorite Italian in North Beach changed owners, I stumbled upon this place and I've found my new favorite pasta.\n\nTheir Pesto Pistachio pasta is fresh, creamy, and a must try for any pesto lover. Coming in at $19, it's well worth every dime! Their Pizzas are worth a try as well. My favorite was the magic mushroom by far, due to the fact the truffle and prosciutto make for a bite that gives you all the feels. My go-to is to order a small pizza, order the pesto pasta, which will be perfect for 2 ppl. Don't forget to try their red pepper olive oil, perfect added touch.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't a fan of was their Sicilian style pizza. Mainly because the crust to filling ratio leaned heavier to the crust side, so that's not really my preference. Bolognese pasta was OK, but is overshadowed by how good the pesto is.\n\nThe staff here is always friendly and inviting. This is a great date spot or for a group of 8. Seating is limited but getting a reservation on yelp has always been easy!",
