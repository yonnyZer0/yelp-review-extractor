  "description": "This is my new favorite restaurant in SF!! The food is authentic Italian and incredible! I had the burrata as an appetizer and it was one of the best I've had. Their bread is baked fresh and comes so hot out of the oven. Their pizza is great and the Tyson Punch Out is my favorite thing on the menu! They have a really cool wood bar and a lot of beers on tap. Love the graffiti art on the wall too. It's a great spot!!!",
