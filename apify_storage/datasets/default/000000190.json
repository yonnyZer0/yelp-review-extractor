  "description": "Pink Onion was a last minute find, but probably the best spot I've been to this year. I absolutely adored it. The space is killer and so cozy and inviting. The food is superb. Very delicious menu of pizza, pasta and starters. They give you just enough variety and very focused. I can't wait to try everything. Customer service is beyond this world. I highly recommend. Please come here!!!!!",
