  "description": "You won't find friendlier servers anywhere.  Really down to earth, making us feel at home. They even understand \"American!\" Place is very popular and crowded. We came for brunch and couldn't have been happier with the quality and quantity of the food.\nPrices are reasonable, and the conversations priceless. Our first time to London and so happy we found this jewel.\nDid I mention the food was great!\nTo all of our American friends, don't miss this fabulous restaurant.",
