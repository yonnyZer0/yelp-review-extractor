  "description": "I stumbled upon Pink Onion after going to the grocery store and being extremely hungry but not feeling like cooking. Naturally when I came across a pizza place I was all in. \n\nWe had the Margherita and Sicilian Pizza, both of which were super greasy and felt super dense. The sicilian was a beast of a pizza and I personally did not like how it was sort of soup-like with the crazy amount of toppings - many of which I didn't feel like went together very well. \n\nThe restaurant is cute and small and service was friendly. They have tons of drink options and it's a great place to hang with people since it had chill vibes. \n\nThis place is alright not the best pizza I've had, might have to come back and try the other things on the menu. If you like hearty pizzas this might be a place to check out!",
