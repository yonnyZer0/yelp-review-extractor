  "description": "There really are few times when we eat out and walk away better than we were when we walked in.  Last night was one of those exceptions. The restaurant is a very cozy and intimate dining area whose street front appearance belies the experience that awaits inside. \n\nWhile there is a printed drink menu, the food menu is written on a quaint chalkboard but be sure to ask about the daily specials! We almost missed out on the two outstanding starters - one, an incredible squid dish in a spicy  salsa-like tomato base with a garnish of fried squid on top, and, as improbable as it may sound, an incredible grilled mango with mushrooms dressed in warm balsamic vinegar. \n\nBecause it is such a throwback menu item, and based on the feedback from our server, we ordered the chicken kiev and the parmesan salad.  Both were extraordinary.\n\nAnd when in London, you mus simply try the sticky toffee pudding which is served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and plenty of warm sauce. We were doing ou happy dance in our heads!\n\nBut perhaps what may have been the icing on the cake was the opportunity to meet Ffiona, hear her story, and gain a better understanding of her craft and craftsmanship. \n\nAll in all a special and memorable dining experience. Though we don't often choose to return to restaurants when we travel (because there are just so many to try!), we absolutely will go back and will recommend visitors try it as well!",
