  "description": "I've been here twice in the last month and both times were good. First visit a little better, I enjoyed the Tyson's punch and the pizza with arugula and prosciutto . Second visit got the pizza with pepperoni and green onion and wasn't as impressed. Also tried the truffle bruschetta which was just ok. Good beer selection and I really enjoyed the wine on tap. It's a small place and they have had sports on the TV both times I have come. Service average but friendly!",
