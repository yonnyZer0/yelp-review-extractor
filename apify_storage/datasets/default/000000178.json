  "description": "We showed up Friday night without a booking (that's w/out a reservation for my fellow Americans) and the place was packed. We were nevertheless promptly and warmly greeted by our hostess, who I subsequently discovered was the owner, Fiona, who found a spot for us and provided us with  an excellent meal. My wife had the lamb, which was perfectly cooked and delicious. According to my better half it was right up there with the New Zealand lamb she has been rhapsodizing about for the last ten years. The new potatoes and braised red cabbage were perfect accompaniments. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry, so I just ordered the duck pate w/sourdough toast, which was also very good.  I wish I had been up to trying the thick cut pork chop. It looked delicious.  Despite the crowd, Fiona made a point of personally engaging each of her guests. We will definitely be returnees to ffiona's on our next trip to London.",
