  "description": "Pink Onion was an unexpected delight in the Inner Mission. My companions and I had drinks at Blondie's, then wandered down to Pink Onion. I was a little concerned how we'd fare, since the number of our party had fluctuated, but the staff of Pink Onion were accommodating and got us our table instantly. The dishes generally were quite good, and the pizza was very satisfying. It's worth taking a trip off the beaten track of Mission and Valencia to come down here and get a real treat.",
