  "description": "We had 2 different pizzas delivered early last night. Order was placed before 7pm. This was the second time we had pizza delivered and the first time the pizza was so good that we were really looking forward to it. But this time we ordered 2 different kinds and they both were awful and the coldest pizza I have ever had delivered.\nDelivery time was way past the yelp estimation time and driver even called and told us to wait downstairs and still did not show up for another 30 minutes.\nSo disappointed because I thought I found perfect pizza delivery for city. It hurts when I remember how great it was 2 weeks ago.",
