  "description": "Amazing!! Was looking for a little pizza before our flight out and found this restaurant. Not only was their wine delicious, but I was obsessed with the bread and olive oil. I'm obsessed with the prosciutto pizza, it's some of the best prosciutto I've ever had! So savory and soft it just melts in your mouth like the butter. We also shared the bolognese and it was perfect, perfect amount of tomato sauce we hate when it's too heavy and acidic. \n\nWe ended up going for an early dinner and the owners, Matt and Niya, were the best hosts telling us all sorts of stories about how they met and started the restaurant. Very authentic and highly recommend",
