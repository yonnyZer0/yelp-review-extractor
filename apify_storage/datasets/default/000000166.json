  "description": "I wasn't expecting Ffiona's to live up to the incredible reviews I see here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I showed up alone, without a reservation but Fiona (is her name really spelled with two ffs? I forgot to ask) graciously found me a seat at a large (communal?) table. the space is pretty small, but the tables are spaced out pretty well so it's intimate but you don't feel like you're sharing your meal with people at the next table. I think there is the one large table which is probably used for walk-ins.\n\nthe menu is written on a big chalkboard. I think there are some daily specials as well as the standard fare. I opted for the grilled avocado which was fantastic. I doubt I would go back and not order it every time. for main they had duck breast that night which was superb.\n\nwine list was not extensive, but enough options, and fairly priced.\n\nbut the best part of the experience is the atmosphere. it's so cozy and inviting and on the night I was there, Fiona was chatting with the customers in a way that made everyone feel like they were friends. she came to my table and talked with me for a while too, which was really nice.\n\nI come to London quite frequently these days and Ffiona's will definitely be on my regular rrotation :)",
