  "description": "Beware if you're ordering delivery to a hotel.  Even after specifying in the instructions I was in a hotel and would need plates and silverware the food arrived without plates, silverware, or napkins.  $15 for a salad and I'm supposed to, what, eat it with my hands like a caveman?  \n\nI called to let them know and the guy working didn't care.  \"Yeah, we don't do that\".  Then don't offer delivery to hotels.  You didn't have a problem taking my $70 order.  If you can't provide utensils call or text me so I can make another choice.  \n\nOnce I found a fork the food was delicious as was the pizza.",
