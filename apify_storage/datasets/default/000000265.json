  "description": "I'm so glad everyone else has such positive things to say about this place, unfortunately that was not my experience. We had a reservation, and when we got there, they had no open tables inside and said \" is a table outside ok?\" Um I guess... it was pretty chilly outside, but I tried my best to overlook that. We were there for about an hour and a half, because that's how long it took to get our 2 salad appetizers and 1 entree. Super underwhelmed, especially given all the 4 and 5 stars.",
