  "description": "I don't know why I was a bit reluctant to try this new spot, but once I did it was one of the most glorious, delish, cozy, modern dining experiences I have had of late.  Although the menu appear a bit simple, each dish was perfectly executed with fresh, bright, vibrant ingredients.  Staff was cool and service on point, while also totally down to earth.  Wines were amazing.  Perfect cozy, comfortable evening.  I look forward to returning many times.",
