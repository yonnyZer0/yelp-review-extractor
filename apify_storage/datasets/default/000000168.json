  "description": "The menu is relatively small ( not a Chinese menu ) and that seems very smart to me. It still offers something for every taste however. We had the duck pate, lamb, fish, chicken Kiev and more and were blown away about the quality of every dish.  Staff and ambiance are top notch and I would highly recommend this place. Loved it.",
