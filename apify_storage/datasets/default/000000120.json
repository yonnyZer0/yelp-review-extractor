  "description": "Love it. Just started ordering from here last month, it's only a mile away, can't believe we waited this long to try out Pink Onion!\n\nAlways order the Margarita. Cheese and sauce are high quality. Not too oily or salty. The crust is thin with a dash of umph, meaning it's not skinny like Tony's it's more similar to an Escape from NY however I'd say the crust is even better. \n\nNomnomnom Pink Onion's a great choice!",
