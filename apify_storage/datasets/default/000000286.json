  "description": "An incredible restaurant with a great staff paired with delicious food, 4.5 stars! \n\nThis place is relatively new, but is absolutely worth the visit! We were huge fans of the service provided by the staff and the fresh food. \n\nTo start off, we were each given Vermouth and ordered the Kanoute pizza. The pizza was very yummy paired with some chili olive oil. The dough, ricotta, and toppings tasted great together. I would personally recommend adding something with a slight crunch to enhance the dish, but regardless it was so yummy! \n\nWe were really hoping to enjoy some tiramisu to top off our dinner but unfortunately the chef who bakes it was in Italy. I will definitely be back to try it hopefully soon! We ended our meal with some white wine to cleanse our palettes courtesy of the restaurant, which was nice. \n\nI would totally recommend this place but I wish they had some dessert to end the meal. I respect that they aren't selling dessert just for the sake of selling it and are waiting for when the chef is back so I'll be back to try more of what's on the menu and hopefully the dessert.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit o the smaller size but it is such a lovely place for some great food with even better service.",
