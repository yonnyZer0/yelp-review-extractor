  "description": "This review is solely on the customer service we received when we were at this restaurant. I say this because we never actually made it to ordering a meal before we left and went to another restaurant. We went this past Sunday (10JUN2018). After a 5 minute wait we were seated and handed menus. Along with the menus (which only had breakfast items and a few other options) there was a large chalkboard portion of the wall which had meal items as well. My wife does not like eggs so we were a bit worried that they were only serving their brunch menu at the time. We tried to flag the waitress 3 TIMES to no avail. She literally would not even look our way...the closest we got was her walking past us and in passing saying \"i'll be right with you\". After about 15 minutes of waiting she finally comes over and says \"are you ready to order\". We ask about the menu and are informed, at this point finally, that it was only the brunch menu. Had she taken 2 seconds to stop and answer a simple question we could have easily been on our way to another local spot. I know that during brunch places can get busy and hectic but it wasn't that busy at the time and she could have easily answered a really easy quick question.",
