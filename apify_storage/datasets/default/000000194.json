  "description": "My new favorite casual place, I only wish it was closer to home.\n\nWe were going to a show at Slim's and this popped up on Yelp.\n\nIt was Tuesday at 5:45 and we got right in. It is a small room, with tables and a bar.\n\nThe bartender came right over with menus an a sample of vermouth (crazy right?) he said he gets it from their wine distributer - it kinda tasted like Pimms.\n\nWe ordered a few things to split. \n-The burrata and prosciutto salad with arugula and roasted pears.\n-The meatballs - AMAZING, they had pine nuts in them and the nice heavy grind of the meat was incredible\n-The pesto pasta with pistachios\n\nThe warm bread they make every hour - comes with a very peppery olive oil.\n\nWe also got a 1/2 carafe of pinot noir.\n\nOur bill was $71 before tax or tip, we were stuffed. Before we left they brought over 2 glasses of port.\n\nCan't wait to come back! (and try the pizza)",
