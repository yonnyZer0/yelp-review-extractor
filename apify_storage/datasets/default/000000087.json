  "description": "One of our favorite meals of our recent trip to London.\nFrom the moment we walked in we felt like we were at a friends house \n for dinner. Outstanding food. We had the Lamb and Fish and chips.\nBoth were some of the best ever. Ffiona the owner was present and \nreally made a great effort to make our evening memorable.Also our server\n a young lady from Portugal (I'm sorry I didn't get her name) was great.\nI can see why shes been in business for 25 years. Great job !!",
