  "description": "Cozy restaurant, with good atmosphere. I had the Veal Chop which was very flavorful, my boyfriend had the Rump & Welsh lamb which was prepared very nicely. For dessert he had the lemon cheesecake and I had the chocolate vegan chocolate cake. Although I liked my dessert a great deal, I do have to say, the lemon cheesecake was hands down the best cheesecake I've ever had. Great place.",
